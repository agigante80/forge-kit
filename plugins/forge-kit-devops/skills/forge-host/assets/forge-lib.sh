# forge-lib-version: 39
# forge-lib.sh: host-aware forge operations (GitHub | Forgejo). Source it; governance components
# call the forge_* functions instead of `gh` directly, so the same logic works whether a repo lives
# on GitHub or a self-hosted Forgejo. ADDITIVE: a repo with no Forgejo config defaults to GitHub and
# behaves exactly as before.
#
# Design note: both backends use the REST API (GitHub via `gh api`, Forgejo via `curl`), NOT gh's
# porcelain, because Forgejo's API is the Gitea API, whose JSON shapes (issues, releases, comments)
# closely match GitHub's REST. Using REST on both sides keeps the jq parsing in callers identical.
#
# Host detection (first match wins, so automation is DETERMINISTIC and never "asks"):
#   1. $FORGE_HOST env var                      (explicit override, e.g. in CI)
#   2. a committed .forge.conf at the repo root (see forge.conf.example)
#   3. the git remote URL                       (github.com -> github; otherwise forgejo IFF a
#                                                Forgejo API URL is configured, else github)
#
# Requires: git, jq. GitHub backend uses `gh` (its existing auth); Forgejo backend uses `curl` + a
# token. Set FORGE_DRY_RUN=1 to print would-be API requests instead of sending them; this also
# short-circuits every GET, so a read under the flag returns empty stdout with rc 0, not real data.
# CONTRACT CHANGES (read this before `forge-adapt refresh forge-lib` lands a new copy).
# `refresh` is report-first for assets, so a human sees the diff; this list is what makes that
# diff mean something, because a byte diff does not say whether a CALLER has to change.
#   v4  forge_issue_label REFUSES ATOMICALLY on any unresolvable name (it used to apply what it
#       could and exit 0). A caller that ignored the exit code now silently applies NO labels
#       where it previously applied some. Check every call site (issue #63).
#   v5  forge_api reports the HTTP status through its EXIT CODE on the forgejo path: 44 for 404,
#       22 for other non-2xx, and curl's own code for a transport failure. A caller that treated
#       any non-zero as fatal now sees 44 for the ordinary "no such org" case. NOTE a 3xx that
#       survives -L now returns 22 where `curl -f` returned 0, because -f only failed on >= 400
#       (issue #78).
#   v6  the config is parsed ONCE per process per working directory instead of on every call. A
#       caller that edited .forge.conf mid-run and expected the next call to see it must now cd
#       out and back, or unset _FORGE_CONF_PWD (issue #78.1).
#   v7  file-derived FORGE_* values are no longer EXPORTED, so they do not reach a child process.
#       This is what makes a child running in a different repo read its OWN .forge.conf. A caller
#       that relied on sourcing forge-lib and then having a child inherit the repo identity must
#       now export the value itself, which is the documented env-wins path anyway (issue #78).
#   v14 forge_issue_comments <n> is NEW (#192): the first read of comments, all pages. Additive; no
#       caller changes. Named here because ticket-gate's round count now depends on it existing,
#       so a project holding forge-lib below v14 gets a round count that cannot run.
#   v15 forge_ci_status on Forgejo returns `cancelled` for a superseded run (it was `failure`), and
#       total_count == 0 is now `pending` (a task exists for the sha) or `none` (asked, nothing
#       there) instead of `not_configured`, which is RESERVED for "could not ask" (#193). A caller
#       that treated not_configured as "fall back to a local test gate" keeps that fallback for
#       the API-error case only; on `none` it must WAIT or confirm there is no CI, and on
#       `cancelled` re-dispatch and re-check. Neither is a local-gate case. `release` is the one
#       caller in the kit that branches on the value, and it does both.
#   v16 forge_host decides the host from the URL's AUTHORITY, by form (#212): on `scheme://` the
#       text after `://` up to the first `/`, `?` or `#`, minus `user@` (stripped first) and
#       `:port`; on the scp form (no `/` before the first `:`) the text before the colon minus
#       `user@`; compared case-insensitively. The old `*://*@github.com/*` glob let `*` cross `/`,
#       so `https://evil.internal/x?z=@github.com/` read as github. The rule is now "any URL
#       whose authority host is github.com (or ssh.github.com)", so answers that were `forgejo`
#       with FORGE_API_URL set are `github` for every such URL the globs missed: a port on the
#       scheme form (`https://github.com:443/o/r`, `ssh://git@github.com:22/o/r`), the scp form
#       without or with a user (`github.com:o/r`, `<user>@github.com:o/r`), a mixed-case
#       spelling, and no path at all.
#       _forge_token's credential host is the same authority, port kept, so a FORGE_API_URL of
#       `https://evil.internal#@github.com` asks git for evil.internal's credential, not github's.
#   v17 forge_repo cuts the slug after the SAME authority _forge_url_host isolates (#216). Three
#       answers change: `git@[::1]:o/r` prints `o/r` (was `:1]:o/r`); a scheme-form `?query` or
#       `#fragment` is stripped (`https://h/o/r?x=1` prints `o/r`, was `o/r?x=1`; the scp form
#       keeps its bytes); and `o/r.git/` prints `o/r` (was `o/r.git`). A URL with no authority is
#       refused with one message naming the URL, with scheme-form userinfo redacted, where v16
#       named a fabricated sub-path (`colon/o/r` for `/path/with:colon/o/r`).
#   v18 forge_api_paginate STOPS on a page whose stable keys (id, else number) equal the previous
#       page's, and says so on stderr; it also names the ordinary empty-page end there (#228). On
#       a host that ignores page= (Gitea's per-issue comments endpoint, go-gitea #6132) a call
#       that spun to the 500-page cap and returned 2 now returns the page once, rc 0, in two
#       requests, so count-gate-rounds reads a number instead of `unknown`. A caller that
#       treated any stderr from a paginate as a failure now sees one line per call. Termination
#       on an EMPTY page is unchanged and `length < limit` is still not a stop.
#   v19 forge_issue_comment, forge_issue_close and forge_issue_edit print ONE stderr line when
#       forge_api returns 44 (`forge-lib: <function>: issue #<n>: HTTP 404 (no such issue)`) and
#       propagate the code (#229). Every other code is unchanged and adds no line, since forge_api,
#       curl or gh already printed one. Success is still silent on both streams. forge_api's own
#       404 arm stays quiet, so read callers that treat 404 as ordinary are untouched.
#   v20 the three writers capture forge_api's code in the errexit-safe shape, so the v19 line is
#       printed under a `set -e` caller too (#237). No caller changes; the codes are unchanged.
#   v21 forge_repo REFUSES an scp remote whose path carries an @ (#235): v20 printed
#       `TOKEN@host:o/r` as the slug for `x-access-token:TOKEN@host:o/r` and every request path
#       carried it. rc 2, nothing on stdout, the remote redacted at its last @ in the message.
#       `git@host:o/r` and `a@b@host:o/r` are unchanged.
#   v22 forge_issue_milestone <n> <title|""> is NEW (#245): the write half of the milestone
#       primitives, setting or clearing a ticket's milestone by title. Additive; no caller
#       changes. It is what lets a phase move happen on a self-hosted forge at all, and the
#       clear form is host-specific (`null` on GitHub, the literal `0` on Forgejo, where a
#       `null` is a silent no-op that returns success).
#   v23 FORGE_DEBUG is NEW (#236): `FORGE_DEBUG=1` makes forge_api_paginate name its ORDINARY
#       end-of-list condition on stderr; every other value, including unset and `0`, is quiet.
#       v18 printed that line unconditionally on every list call, so `/phase` (which reaches
#       the paginator through forge_milestone_list and does not redirect stderr) and a gate run
#       filing a ticket both opened with lines of routine noise. Quiet is the new default and
#       matches what every caller that was redirecting the line away already saw.
#       THE ANOMALY LINES ARE NOT GATED and must not be: the identical-page stop says the server
#       is ignoring `page`, and the two rc-2 lines say the walk could not continue. A caller
#       needs all three whether or not it asked for debugging.
#       The test is `= 1`, matching every FORGE_DRY_RUN guard in this file; `!= 0` would have
#       made `FORGE_DEBUG=no` turn debugging on.
#   v24 forge_body_region_get / _set / _clear and forge_body_compose_preserving are NEW (#248):
#       the write-authority contract for the three components that edit a ticket body. Additive;
#       forge_issue_edit is unchanged and still destroys what was there, which is why the governed
#       writers stop calling it. New return codes 101 (a prefix refusal), 102 (the body moved since
#       it was read) and 103 (a malformed or unterminated marker pair), chosen above curl's 1 to 99
#       so a refusal cannot be confused with a transport failure this library propagates.
#       The contract lives HERE rather than in a governance doc because a governance guard cannot
#       reach the third writer at all: that writer ships in an OPTIONAL group the guard neither
#       scans nor can be made to scan. Every group that needs this already depends on this one, so
#       the contract travels down an edge that exists. Nothing here names a component or a group,
#       deliberately: an earlier draft of this very comment named one and the isolation guard
#       refused the build, which is the second time a comment in this file explaining a boundary
#       has crossed it.
#   v25 forge_body_compose_preserving LOSES its <prefix> argument (#248 review round 1). v24 took
#       one and re-threaded only the regions that did NOT match it, so a caller rewriting an author
#       section with its OWN prefix deleted its own regions and returned 0. It now re-threads every
#       region present in the current body and absent from the new one, so a caller keeps a region
#       it deliberately restates and loses none by omission. CALLERS MUST DROP THE ARGUMENT.
#       Also in v25, all defects rather than contract changes: one marker grammar shared by every
#       function, so the composer refuses what the splice refuses and preserves a CRLF body rather
#       than dropping its regions; content carrying a marker line is refused, since it locked the
#       region permanently; content travels by FILE, removing the MAX_ARG_STRLEN ceiling; a non-2xx
#       or non-issue response no longer reads as an empty body; a fetch failure in the region
#       reader is no longer indistinguishable from an absent region.
#   v27 forge_body_region_set takes an optional FIFTH argument, `top` (#284): the region is placed
#       at the top of the body (after a leading template-version marker line), and an existing one
#       is MOVED there. Additive: without it the output is byte-identical to v26. Any other fifth
#       argument exits 2, since a typo that silently appended would hide the region it was moving.
#   v28 forge_milestone_close decides FORGE_DRY_RUN BEFORE it resolves the title (#254). v27
#       resolved first, and under the flag the paginator returns a literal `[]`, so every title
#       was unresolvable: a dry run returned 2 and said `no milestone titled` for a milestone
#       that exists. It now prints `[dry-run] close milestone <title> on <repo>` to stderr and
#       returns 0, sending nothing. A caller that saw rc 2 under the flag now sees rc 0, and a
#       title that does NOT exist also returns 0 under the flag (the caller resolved it from a
#       real read; forge_issue_milestone makes the same trade). A real run is unchanged.
#   v29 An INVALID host is refused instead of read as success (#256). forge_host refuses an
#       invalid FORGE_HOST (printing nothing on stdout), and every consumer that matched its
#       output with a `case` fell through: the writers returned 0 having sent nothing. Each now
#       captures the host and returns 2, with exactly one stderr line (forge_host's own), and the
#       capture sits ABOVE every dry-run guard, so FORGE_DRY_RUN=1 refuses too: no `[dry-run]`
#       line, rc 2. Covers forge_api, forge_api_paginate, forge_issue_list, forge_issue_label,
#       forge_milestone_list, forge_milestone_close, forge_issue_edit, _forge_region_write (so
#       forge_body_region_set and _clear) and forge_body_compose_preserving; the writers that go
#       through forge_api inherit it for real sends. Two exceptions to the literal `return 2`:
#       forge_ci_status prints `not_configured` and returns 0, since that word is its documented
#       "could not ask" answer and a caller acts on it (rc 2 with empty stdout would break that
#       contract); the executed-directly `detect` CLI is top-level code, so it `exit 2`s with
#       nothing on stdout.
#       forge_tag_exists returns 2 under an invalid host (it hides stderr), which means "could
#       not ask", NOT "tag absent". A caller that saw rc 0 from a write now sees rc 2; valid
#       hosts are unchanged. forge_api_base already refused and is left alone.
#   v32 No caller changes (#264). forge_issue_edit's dry-run line says `characters` where it said
#       `bytes`: the number was always `${#2}`, a character count in a multibyte locale, and
#       nothing parses the line. The splice's whitespace and line-ending behaviour is now stated
#       (see the body-region block) and pinned by tests; the code behind it is unchanged.
#   v35 forge_issue_milestone_list returned [] on Forgejo (#446). It excluded PRs with
#       `has("pull_request") | not`, and Forgejo sends `"pull_request": null` on EVERY plain issue,
#       so every issue was dropped and check-phases rules 1 and 4 and reassess's emptied check ran
#       over nothing. It now uses `.pull_request | not`, false for an absent key and for null alike,
#       the filter forge_issue_list already used. GitHub output is unchanged.
#   v36 The Forgejo token is bound to where it may go (#442). A FORGE_API_URL from .forge.conf
#       needs its host[:port] in ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/forge/hosts or forge_api
#       refuses with rc 2 and sends nothing; an exported FORGE_API_URL needs no entry. Every
#       FORGE_API_URL must be https (http only with FORGE_ALLOW_HTTP=1 exported). The file may
#       set FORGE_TOKEN_ENV only to FORGEJO_TOKEN or FORGE_TOKEN; another name must be exported.
#       Redirects are no longer followed (a 3xx is rc 22). The token reaches curl through -K,
#       never argv. New: forge_token_present, for a caller that only asks whether a token is set.
#   v38 Review lows of #442 (#449). New public forge_url_check: silent rc 0 when FORGE_API_URL would
#       be accepted (https, and on the allowlist if it came from .forge.conf), else the refusal and
#       rc 2; a no-op on GitHub, reads no token. Every dry-run branch now calls it first on
#       Forgejo, so a dry run refuses what the real run refuses (forge_api_paginate returns
#       forge_api's rc instead of printing `[]` after a refusal). A 3xx is rc 22: the remedy is a
#       FORGE_API_URL that names the final location. Comment fixes only otherwise.
#   v37 forge_ci_status and forge_ci_no_status_kind stop discarding forge_api's stderr (#450). A
#       refusal (host not in the allowlist, non-https, empty or unsafe token, bad FORGE_TOKEN_ENV,
#       invalid host) now reaches the caller's stderr, once, instead of leaving a bare
#       `not_configured` with no reason. stdout is unchanged (one vocabulary word) and so is rc 0.
#       Side effects, intended: a real HTTP failure prints forge_api's own `HTTP <n>` line, and
#       FORGE_DRY_RUN=1 prints its single `[dry-run]` request line. 404 and an empty body stay
#       silent. The GitHub arm is unchanged.
#       Both curl calls in forge_api now start with -q, so the user's .curlrc is never read: a
#       `verbose` line there would print the Authorization header to the stderr this change exposes.
#       Migration: -q drops EVERY .curlrc setting, so a private CA (`cacert`) or proxy set only there
#       now fails (curl rc 60 or 7). Set it through CURL_CA_BUNDLE, SSL_CERT_FILE or https_proxy.
# Add a line here whenever a change alters what a caller must do, not merely what the library
# does internally.

# Forgejo termination is an EMPTY page or an IDENTICAL page (#228, keys compared, see the loop),
# deliberately NOT `length < limit`: the server clamps
# `limit` to its admin-set MAX_RESPONSE_ITEMS (stock default 50), so a clamped page satisfies
# `< limit` while pages remain, which would silently reproduce the exact single-page
# truncation this helper exists to fix (issue #62). One extra request per call is the price
# of being clamp-proof. Guards, each an ERROR (return 2), never a silent end-of-list: a
# non-array body (a JSON error object's `length` counts KEYS, which would read as items and
# loop forever), an empty or unparseable body mid-run (a `[ '' -gt 0 ]` would break the loop
# and return rc 0 on a partial list), and a page cap (FORGE_PAGINATE_MAX_PAGES, default 500 =
# 25k items at stock clamp) so a server that ignores `page` spins the cap, not forever.
# Pages accumulate in a TEMP FILE, never a jq --argjson argument: a single execve argument is
# capped at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (~128KiB on Linux), and one real page of template-v4-sized issues
# measures at that ceiling, so argv accumulation hard-fails on exactly the repos pagination
# exists for. File/stdin input has no such limit (and avoids re-parsing prior pages each loop).

#
# The EXIT trap is installed ONLY when the caller has none. A sourced library that overwrites its
# caller's trap is a worse bug than a leaked file. Where the caller does have one, the normal

# --- the body-region primitives (#248) ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# forge_issue_edit is "the one write in this library that DESTROYS what was there". Three components
# will write a ticket body once the phase reviews land, and the rule keeping two of them apart was
# one sentence of prose. A rule in a GOVERNANCE doc cannot reach the third writer at all: it ships
# in an OPTIONAL group the governance guard neither scans nor can be made to scan. So the contract
# lives HERE, every group that needs it already declares this one as a dependency, and it fires at
# the write rather than at a guard over prose. This file names no component and no group.
#
# ONE DEFINITION OF A MARKER, SHARED BY EVERY FUNCTION. The first cut had two: the splice matched a
# prefix and the composer matched an anchored regex, so five ordinary bodies (CRLF from the GitHub
# web form, a region name with a dot, a marker with trailing text, an unterminated region, content
# holding a stray end marker) made the COMPOSER silently drop regions and return 0, while the splice
# refused the same shapes. The one function that rewrites a whole body was the one with no guard.
# Both now normalise a line the same way and refuse the same shapes.
#
# A MARKER IS A WHOLE LINE, after a trailing CR and trailing blanks are stripped, exactly
# `<!-- <name>:start -->` or `<!-- <name>:end -->`. A line that BEGINS with one and carries other
# text is REFUSED rather than read as a marker or as prose, because it is a body a human edited and
# guessing which they meant is how the edit gets eaten.
#
# WHAT IT ENFORCES IS DISJOINTNESS, NOT OWNERSHIP. Nothing stops a caller declaring a prefix it does
# not own. That is acceptable because the failure prevented is a full-body overwrite by a buggy
# component, not impersonation by a hostile one.
#
# WHAT THE SPLICE DOES TO WHITESPACE AND LINE ENDINGS IT DID NOT AUTHOR (#264). It writes LF, and
# it does not normalise what is around a region. A body filed through the GitHub web form is CRLF,
# so after a set the author's lines keep their CRLF while the marker lines and the content are LF:
# the body ends up with mixed line endings, and every marker still matches (a trailing CR is
# stripped before comparison). An EMPTY body gains exactly one leading blank line before the start
# marker. The body's trailing newlines collapse to exactly one (the read is a command substitution),
# so an author's trailing blank lines are dropped. Compose (forge_body_compose_preserving), not this
# splice, decides the spacing before a re-threaded region. Line endings are documented rather than
# normalised on purpose: normalising would rewrite author lines the splice has no business touching.
# Tests pin the CRLF, empty-body and trailing-newline behaviours, so changing one is deliberate.
#
# LAST-WRITER-WINS IS STRUCTURAL. GitHub offers no If-Match on an issue-body PATCH, so the re-read
# before the write NARROWS the window and cannot close it. Do not propose a lock as the fix.
#
# CODES 101 (a prefix refusal), 102 (the body moved since it was read) and 103 (a malformed,
# unterminated or duplicated marker pair, or content that would create one). Above curl's 1 to 99,
# because forge_api propagates curl's own code and a collision would make a refusal look like a
# network error; below the 126 the shell reserves. A splice that fails for ANY OTHER reason returns
# 2 and says so, rather than being laundered into 103 and sending someone to fix markers that are
# fine.
#
# CONTENT TRAVELS BY FILE, NOT BY ENVIRONMENT. A single execve argument is capped at
# MAX_ARG_STRLEN, about 128KiB on Linux, which this library's own paginator header already warns
# about; Forgejo puts no cap on a body, so a large one is reachable. Only the region NAME goes
# through ENVIRON, and never through `-v`, which Apple's awk refuses a newline in.

# through `gh issue edit --milestone` and was GitHub-only. `/phase` is the consumer.
#
# Two host differences, both verified at source rather than assumed. The id to send is the
# per-repo NUMBER on GitHub ("the number of the milestone", issue PATCH) and the `id` on
# Forgejo, whose handler passes it to a primary-key lookup; `forge_milestone_list` already
# normalises the two into one field, and `_forge_milestone_id` resolves it, so the resolution
# is reused rather than rewritten. And the CLEAR form differs: GitHub documents `null`, while
# Forgejo and Gitea declare the field `*int64` and gate the handler on it being non-nil, so a
# `null` there is a SILENT no-op returning success and only the literal `0` unsets it. A wrong
# clear form is therefore loud on neither host and indistinguishable from success on one, which
# is the #229 class.
#
# The dry-run guard runs BEFORE the resolution, as forge_issue_label's does: under FORGE_DRY_RUN

# --- CI status (runner-dependent) ---

# forge_ci_status <branch>  -> success | failure | cancelled | pending | none | not_configured
# (github also passes other raw GH conclusions like timed_out/skipped through). `cancelled` = a
# run was superseded, not broken, and both hosts can return it. `pending` = a run exists but has not
# concluded; `none` = asked, and no run exists; `not_configured` = COULD NOT ASK (unparseable remote,
# empty ref, API error, empty body), so callers (release) degrade gracefully (e.g. a local
# `make test` gate) instead of hard-failing. The two hosts agree on this vocabulary since v14.
#
# Forgejo: Forgejo Actions writes a COMMIT STATUS per job, so the combined commit-status endpoint
# (`/commits/{sha}/status`) is the simple, correct "is CI green?" check, better than the
# version-split /actions/runs|/actions/tasks API. (On GitHub the combined status does NOT reflect
# Actions (those are Checks), so the github path uses `gh run list`.) We resolve to a SHA because
# the combined status has known quirks on branch/tag refs.
#
# TWO EXCEPTIONS, and the first cost a wrongly filed ticket to find (#193).
#
# The combined status reports a CANCELLED run as `failure`. Pushing twice in quick succession
# supersedes the first run, so a healthy branch shows red commits with no failing step anywhere,
# and "why did it fail?" has no answer because nothing did; v13 was wrong on 23 of 39 red commits in
# the sample that ticket measured. The answer is ALREADY IN THE RESPONSE: Forgejo writes a hard-coded
# English description per job (services/actions/commit_status.go: "Has been cancelled",
# "Failing after 12s", ...), so the red path decides from the rows it holds and asks NOTHING else.
# Red state, every red row "Has been cancelled" -> cancelled; any red row saying anything else, or
# nothing -> failure. An unknown string therefore falls to v13's answer, never to a false green.
# The alternative, walking /actions/tasks, was rejected: it is paginated, version-split, and under
# a server-clamped page it reported `cancelled` with a failure on the next page.
#
# `total_count == 0` does NOT mean "this repo has no CI". It means no status row exists YET: a
# queued or just-started run has none, and reading that as not_configured told the caller to stop
# looking while the task was running. ONE page of /actions/tasks decides (never a walk): a task for
# the sha is `pending`, none is `none`, and an endpoint that cannot be asked stays `not_configured`,
# which keeps the runner-less fallback exactly where v13 had it. The sha match is a PREFIX match,
# because the ref falls back to its literal, possibly short, form for a sha in another repository.
# forge_api's stderr is NOT discarded at either call site (#450): a refusal (allowlist, non-https,
# empty or unsafe token, bad FORGE_TOKEN_ENV, invalid host) is the only explanation a caller gets
# for `not_configured`. Passthrough means untouched: nothing here adds, filters or rewrites it, and
