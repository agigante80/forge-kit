# forge-lib-version: 22
# forge-lib.sh: host-aware forge operations (GitHub | Forgejo). Source it; governance components
# call the forge_* functions instead of `gh` directly, so the same logic works whether a repo lives
# on GitHub or a self-hosted Forgejo. ADDITIVE: a repo with no Forgejo config defaults to GitHub and
# behaves exactly as before.
#
# Design note: both backends use the REST API (GitHub via `gh api`, Forgejo via `curl`), NOT gh's
# porcelain, because Forgejo's API is the Gitea API, whose JSON shapes (issues, releases, comments)
# closely match GitHub's REST. Using REST on both sides keeps the jq parsing in callers identical.
#
# Host detection (first match wins, so automation is DETERMINISTIC and never "asks"):
#   1. $FORGE_HOST env var                      (explicit override, e.g. in CI)
#   2. a committed .forge.conf at the repo root (see forge.conf.example)
#   3. the git remote URL                       (github.com -> github; otherwise forgejo IFF a
#                                                Forgejo API URL is configured, else github)
#
# Requires: git, jq. GitHub backend uses `gh` (its existing auth); Forgejo backend uses `curl` + a
# token. Set FORGE_DRY_RUN=1 to print would-be API requests instead of sending them.
# CONTRACT CHANGES (read this before `forge-adapt refresh forge-lib` lands a new copy).
# `refresh` is report-first for assets, so a human sees the diff; this list is what makes that
# diff mean something, because a byte diff does not say whether a CALLER has to change.
#   v4  forge_issue_label REFUSES ATOMICALLY on any unresolvable name (it used to apply what it
#       could and exit 0). A caller that ignored the exit code now silently applies NO labels
#       where it previously applied some. Check every call site (issue #63).
#   v5  forge_api reports the HTTP status through its EXIT CODE on the forgejo path: 44 for 404,
#       22 for other non-2xx, and curl's own code for a transport failure. A caller that treated
#       any non-zero as fatal now sees 44 for the ordinary "no such org" case. NOTE a 3xx that
#       survives -L now returns 22 where `curl -f` returned 0, because -f only failed on >= 400
#       (issue #78).
#   v6  the config is parsed ONCE per process per working directory instead of on every call. A
#       caller that edited .forge.conf mid-run and expected the next call to see it must now cd
#       out and back, or unset _FORGE_CONF_PWD (issue #78.1).
#   v7  file-derived FORGE_* values are no longer EXPORTED, so they do not reach a child process.
#       This is what makes a child running in a different repo read its OWN .forge.conf. A caller
#       that relied on sourcing forge-lib and then having a child inherit the repo identity must
#       now export the value itself, which is the documented env-wins path anyway (issue #78).
#   v14 forge_issue_comments <n> is NEW (#192): the first read of comments, all pages. Additive; no
#       caller changes. Named here because ticket-gate's round count now depends on it existing,
#       so a project holding forge-lib below v14 gets a round count that cannot run.
#   v15 forge_ci_status on Forgejo returns `cancelled` for a superseded run (it was `failure`), and
#       total_count == 0 is now `pending` (a task exists for the sha) or `none` (asked, nothing
#       there) instead of `not_configured`, which is RESERVED for "could not ask" (#193). A caller
#       that treated not_configured as "fall back to a local test gate" keeps that fallback for
#       the API-error case only; on `none` it must WAIT or confirm there is no CI, and on
#       `cancelled` re-dispatch and re-check. Neither is a local-gate case. `release` is the one
#       caller in the kit that branches on the value, and it does both.
#   v16 forge_host decides the host from the URL's AUTHORITY, by form (#212): on `scheme://` the
#       text after `://` up to the first `/`, `?` or `#`, minus `user@` (stripped first) and
#       `:port`; on the scp form (no `/` before the first `:`) the text before the colon minus
#       `user@`; compared case-insensitively. The old `*://*@github.com/*` glob let `*` cross `/`,
#       so `https://evil.internal/x?z=@github.com/` read as github. The rule is now "any URL
#       whose authority host is github.com (or ssh.github.com)", so answers that were `forgejo`
#       with FORGE_API_URL set are `github` for every such URL the globs missed: a port on the
#       scheme form (`https://github.com:443/o/r`, `ssh://git@github.com:22/o/r`), the scp form
#       without or with a user (`github.com:o/r`, `<user>@github.com:o/r`), a mixed-case
#       spelling, and no path at all.
#       _forge_token's credential host is the same authority, port kept, so a FORGE_API_URL of
#       `https://evil.internal#@github.com` asks git for evil.internal's credential, not github's.
#   v17 forge_repo cuts the slug after the SAME authority _forge_url_host isolates (#216). Three
#       answers change: `git@[::1]:o/r` prints `o/r` (was `:1]:o/r`); a scheme-form `?query` or
#       `#fragment` is stripped (`https://h/o/r?x=1` prints `o/r`, was `o/r?x=1`; the scp form
#       keeps its bytes); and `o/r.git/` prints `o/r` (was `o/r.git`). A URL with no authority is
#       refused with one message naming the URL, with scheme-form userinfo redacted, where v16
#       named a fabricated sub-path (`colon/o/r` for `/path/with:colon/o/r`).
#   v18 forge_api_paginate STOPS on a page whose stable keys (id, else number) equal the previous
#       page's, and says so on stderr; it also names the ordinary empty-page end there (#228). On
#       a host that ignores page= (Gitea's per-issue comments endpoint, go-gitea #6132) a call
#       that spun to the 500-page cap and returned 2 now returns the page once, rc 0, in two
#       requests, so count-gate-rounds reads a number instead of `unknown`. A caller that
#       treated any stderr from a paginate as a failure now sees one line per call. Termination
#       on an EMPTY page is unchanged and `length < limit` is still not a stop.
#   v19 forge_issue_comment, forge_issue_close and forge_issue_edit print ONE stderr line when
#       forge_api returns 44 (`forge-lib: <function>: issue #<n>: HTTP 404 (no such issue)`) and
#       propagate the code (#229). Every other code is unchanged and adds no line, since forge_api,
#       curl or gh already printed one. Success is still silent on both streams. forge_api's own
#       404 arm stays quiet, so read callers that treat 404 as ordinary are untouched.
#   v20 the three writers capture forge_api's code in the errexit-safe shape, so the v19 line is
#       printed under a `set -e` caller too (#237). No caller changes; the codes are unchanged.
#   v21 forge_repo REFUSES an scp remote whose path carries an @ (#235): v20 printed
#       `TOKEN@host:o/r` as the slug for `x-access-token:TOKEN@host:o/r` and every request path
#       carried it. rc 2, nothing on stdout, the remote redacted at its last @ in the message.
#       `git@host:o/r` and `a@b@host:o/r` are unchanged.
#   v22 forge_issue_milestone <n> <title|""> is NEW (#245): the write half of the milestone
#       primitives, setting or clearing a ticket's milestone by title. Additive; no caller
#       changes. It is what lets a phase move happen on a self-hosted forge at all, and the
#       clear form is host-specific (`null` on GitHub, the literal `0` on Forgejo, where a
#       `null` is a silent no-op that returns success).
# Add a line here whenever a change alters what a caller must do, not merely what the library
# does internally.

# to re-run this about four times, via forge_host, forge_api_base and _forge_token, each costing a
# `git rev-parse` plus a fork per config line.
#
# File-derived values are set as PLAIN shell variables and deliberately NOT exported, so they never
# reach a child process; a child sourcing this library in another repo reads that repo's own file.
# Exporting them was a long-standing bug, not one this branch introduced: measured on the pre-#78
# baseline and on this branch, any forge_* call made OUTSIDE a command substitution leaked the repo
# identity to every later child, identically on both. What #78.1 changed is the REACH, because
# loading in forge_api_paginate's own shell (which is what makes the memo pay) turned the common
# paginated path into one of those direct calls.
#
# Values set FROM THE FILE are also tracked and cleared when the working directory changes, so a
# process that moves between repos re-reads correctly in-shell.
#
# The tracking records the VALUE the file wrote, not just the key (#131.1). By key alone, a caller
# that exported a FORGE_* value AFTER a load which had set that same key from a file had its export
# cleared on the next chdir, contradicting the env-wins contract stated above and in
# references/local-auth.md. Comparing the current value against what the file wrote distinguishes
# the two without reading the export attribute, whose portable readings cost a fork per key
# (`declare -p`) or need bash 5.0 (`${!k@a}`) in a library that runs on 3.1.

# JSON array, host-aware: github delegates to `gh api --paginate` (which merges pages into one
# array without -q); forgejo loops page/limit itself, appending '?' or '&' as the path needs.
# Forgejo termination is an EMPTY page or an IDENTICAL page (#228, keys compared, see the loop),
# deliberately NOT `length < limit`: the server clamps
# `limit` to its admin-set MAX_RESPONSE_ITEMS (stock default 50), so a clamped page satisfies
# `< limit` while pages remain, which would silently reproduce the exact single-page
# truncation this helper exists to fix (issue #62). One extra request per call is the price
# of being clamp-proof. Guards, each an ERROR (return 2), never a silent end-of-list: a
# non-array body (a JSON error object's `length` counts KEYS, which would read as items and
# loop forever), an empty or unparseable body mid-run (a `[ '' -gt 0 ]` would break the loop
# and return rc 0 on a partial list), and a page cap (FORGE_PAGINATE_MAX_PAGES, default 500 =
# 25k items at stock clamp) so a server that ignores `page` spins the cap, not forever.
# Pages accumulate in a TEMP FILE, never a jq --argjson argument: a single execve argument is
# capped at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (~128KiB on Linux), and one real page of template-v4-sized issues

# Forgejo: Forgejo Actions writes a COMMIT STATUS per job, so the combined commit-status endpoint
# (`/commits/{sha}/status`) is the simple, correct "is CI green?" check, better than the
# version-split /actions/runs|/actions/tasks API. (On GitHub the combined status does NOT reflect
# Actions (those are Checks), so the github path uses `gh run list`.) We resolve to a SHA because
# the combined status has known quirks on branch/tag refs.
#
# TWO EXCEPTIONS, and the first cost a wrongly filed ticket to find (#193).
#
# The combined status reports a CANCELLED run as `failure`. Pushing twice in quick succession
# supersedes the first run, so a healthy branch shows red commits with no failing step anywhere,
# and "why did it fail?" has no answer because nothing did; v13 was wrong on 23 of 39 red commits in
# the sample that ticket measured. The answer is ALREADY IN THE RESPONSE: Forgejo writes a hard-coded
# English description per job (services/actions/commit_status.go: "Has been cancelled",
# "Failing after 12s", ...), so the red path decides from the rows it holds and asks NOTHING else.
# Red state, every red row "Has been cancelled" -> cancelled; any red row saying anything else, or
# nothing -> failure. An unknown string therefore falls to v13's answer, never to a false green.
# The alternative, walking /actions/tasks, was rejected: it is paginated, version-split, and under
# a server-clamped page it reported `cancelled` with a failure on the next page.
#
# `total_count == 0` does NOT mean "this repo has no CI". It means no status row exists YET: a
# queued or just-started run has none, and reading that as not_configured told the caller to stop
# looking while the task was running. ONE page of /actions/tasks decides (never a walk): a task for
# the sha is `pending`, none is `none`, and an endpoint that cannot be asked stays `not_configured`,
# which keeps the runner-less fallback exactly where v13 had it. The sha match is a PREFIX match,
# because the ref falls back to its literal, possibly short, form for a sha in another repository.
