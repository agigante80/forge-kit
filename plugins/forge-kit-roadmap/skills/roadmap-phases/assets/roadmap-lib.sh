# roadmap-lib-version: 12
#
# The roadmap format, defined ONCE and sourced by both roadmap assets (issue #162).
#
# WHY THIS IS A LIBRARY AND NOT DUPLICATED CODE. parse_roadmap is not two similar behaviours that
# happen to look alike; it is ONE definition of a file format with two consumers. If check-phases.sh
# and sync-phases.sh ever parsed the roadmap differently, the guard would pass a file the sync then
# mis-applies. Divergence is a defect BY DEFINITION rather than a possibility, and that is exactly
# what separates a shared specification from the incidental similarity the Rule of Three warns
# against extracting too early.
#
# It shipped duplicated, guarded by a byte-identity test, on a precedent that did not apply: #112
# and #77 guard copies because extraction is IMPOSSIBLE there (a glob is not a regex; the prose
# sites need an inline fallback). Here it is possible, and sync-labels.sh sourcing forge-lib.sh is
# the pattern already proven in this repo.
#
# Source it, do not execute it. Anchor to ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}, never the working directory.
#
# v2 (#246) adds the WRITE half. Until it existed the kit could read the roadmap and not
# reshape it, so every phase move was a hand edit and the two consumers that need one
# (a phase review, a roadmap reassessment) would each have had to learn the format again.
# See the block above the primitives for the return codes and the invariant they all verify.
#
# v3 (#246 review round 1) fixed two defects the first cut shipped with, both of which the
# parse-back check was structurally blind to. Arguments were bound unguarded, so under the
# `set -u` both consumers run, a short call aborted the CALLER instead of returning 2. And
# caller text travelled to awk through `-v`, which processes backslash escapes, so a plan
# path or a phase name carrying \t was written with a literal tab; the intent and the write
# were computed through the same mangling, so they agreed and the seam check passed it.
#
# v4 (#246 review round 2) fixed three defects IN v3's fixes. A blank line between phases
# belongs to the position rather than to the block, so a move between a heading-terminated
# position and EOF gained or lost a line; blank lines are not a parsed field, so the seam
# check could not see that either. Arity was inferred from emptiness, which is right for
# five primitives and wrong for the two whose argument may legitimately be empty: a
# two-argument set_prose passed the check and ERASED the phase prose with rc 0, and
# set_plan could not clear a plan that rule 2 does not require. And the bounded symlink
# walk stopped at the tenth hop and wrote there, severing a link mid-chain; it now refuses.
#
# v6 (#270) makes EMPTY prose a fixed point. set_prose "" used to emit its leading blank, an
# empty prose line and a trailing blank, so a keyed-only block gained blank lines on every
# call and the no-op short-circuit never fired. See the comments in set_prose and insert_at.
#
# v11 (#260) closes three edges. A phase NAME is validated by one helper, _rm_name_ok, called by
# rename and insert_at (a tab in a name used to return 0 and split every consumer's TSV row).
# set_plan fills a phase that has NO plan line instead of dying with 5, and counts `state:` lines
# on every call. insert_at writes `plan:` with no trailing space for an empty plan, so it agrees
# with set_plan; that reverses the literal `plan: ` #270 pinned, and the two assertions that pinned
# it (the e4 and e5 cases of test-roadmap-lib.sh) were updated with this change.
#
# v12 (#345) makes _rm_prose_ok refuse a prose holding a column-0 `state:` or `plan:` line, rc 5. A
# keyed line equal to the block's current value used to land as a second keyed line (rc 0) through
# set_prose and insert_at. BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: a keyed prose line with a DIFFERENT value moves from rc 3
# (the parse-back) to rc 5 (this guard, before the file is touched).

# --- portability ------------------------------------------------------------
# macOS still ships bash 3.2 and a BSD readlink with no -f, and this is installed into other
# people's repositories. A guard that dies on a contributor's laptop is a guard they remove.

# --- the WRITE primitives (#246) ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The library was a parser with no writer, so reshaping the roadmap was a hand edit and any
# component that reshaped it would have been the format's SECOND definition of this file, which is
# the drift #162 removed. Seven primitives, because five were not enough for the consumers that
# justify them: /phase review must update a phase's prose when scope changes, and a roadmap
# reassessment must merge and refocus a phase and write the reason into the prose.
#
# THEY RETURN, THEY NEVER EXIT. This library is sourced and its own header says so; a library that
# exits kills its caller's shell. Codes: 0 done, 2 a usage error OR an I/O failure, 3 the file is
# malformed or the parser disagrees with what was written, 5 a POLICY refusal on a well-formed
# file. Not 4: sync-phases.sh and sync-labels.sh already use 4 for "a write failed part-way; the
# host may be partially synced", which is the opposite of "nothing was written", and every consumer
# sources those assets. Usage and I/O share 2 deliberately rather than splitting: both mean the
# call could not be carried out and nothing was written, and a caller has the stderr line to tell
# them apart.
#
# EVERY ARGUMENT IS BOUND WITH ${n-}, which is not a style choice. Both consumers run `set -u`, and
# so does every contract test in this tree, so an unguarded `local st="$3"` on a short call aborts
# the CALLER's shell before the function can return anything at all. The promise three paragraphs
# up is only true if the arity check is reachable, and under `set -u` it is not reachable unless
# the binding is guarded first.
#
# CALLER TEXT REACHES awk THROUGH ENVIRON, NEVER THROUGH -v, and every site does it the same way.
# `awk -v x="$v"` processes backslash escapes in the value, so a plan path containing \t is WRITTEN
# as a literal tab; a phase name is worse, because parse_roadmap emits TSV and a name carrying a
# tab splits into the state column, which every consumer then reads as garbage. The parse-back
# check cannot see it, because the intent and the write were computed through the same mangling and
# therefore agree. Apple's awk additionally refuses a -v value containing a newline outright, which
# is #205's finding. The form used here is a COMMAND-PREFIX assignment, `RM_X="$v" awk ...`, which
# puts the value in that one command's environment and leaves nothing behind in the caller's.
# The rule covers DERIVED text too, not only what a caller typed: a temp path built from the
# roadmap's own directory carries whatever that directory is named, so the three sites that pass a
# filename to awk pass it the same way. No `-v` remains in this file (#412): line numbers and the
# `state`/`plan` key go through RM_S/RM_E/RM_AT/RM_K and are read in BEGIN with `+ 0`, and `OFS` is
# a program literal, `BEGIN { OFS = "\t" }`, never ENVIRON, because the awk lexer processes the
# `\t` there while ENVIRON keeps it as two bytes (the parse-back check then refuses the write).
#
# THE WRITER'S EXTENT IS NARROWER THAN THE PARSER'S, on purpose: a block runs to the next `## `
# line, not the next `## Phase:`, so a trailing `## Notes` section is never absorbed into the prose
# a primitive rewrites. That difference is a seam, and the seam is CHECKED rather than trusted:
# every primitive parses its candidate result before the rename and refuses with 3 if parse_roadmap
# disagrees with what it wrote. An invariant that is verified cannot drift from the parser.
#
# AMBIGUITY REFUSES. Two column-0 `state:` or `plan:` lines in one block, or two phases with one
# name, are files the parser tolerates and a writer cannot act on: it cannot tell which line the
# file means. Refusing is the only honest answer, and it is where the writer is deliberately
# stricter than the parser, which must keep reading an imperfect file.
#
# ABSENCE IS FILLED, AMBIGUITY REFUSES (#260). set_plan on a block with zero `plan:` lines and a
# non-empty path writes ONE `plan: <path>` line directly after the single `state:` line, which is
# the order insert_at writes. More than one `state:` or more than one `plan:` still returns 5, and
# the `state:` count runs on EVERY set_plan call, replace and empty-path branches included, so a
# no-op can never mask a malformed block (a two-`state:` block that set_plan once accepted is now
# refused, as set_state always did). An empty path on a plan-less block is an rc 0 no-op. A block
# with no `state:` line is malformed and returns 3 from _rm_prepare. set_plan never creates a block.
#
# NAMESPACE. This half reserves `RM_*` in the caller's shell. `RM_START`, `RM_END` and `RM_EXPECT`
# are plain globals, because a shell function returns one integer and these need to return more.
# Nothing here is exported.
