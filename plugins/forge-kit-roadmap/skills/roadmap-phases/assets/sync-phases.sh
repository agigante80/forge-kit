# NO `awk -v` IN THIS FILE (#259). `-v` runs a backslash-escape pass over its value and Apple's awk
# refuses one holding a newline, so the one site that took a value, the MALFORMED diagnostic's
# `--roadmap` path (caller text), reads it through ENVIRON instead. scripts/test-sync-phases.sh
# counts zero `awk ... -v` lines (scripts/awkv-count.sh, continuations joined). No awk takes a file
# operand either (#405): a `name=value` operand is an assignment, so files come in through `<`.
#
# Makes the host's milestones match docs/roadmap.md, or reports that they do not.
#
#   sync-phases.sh [--check] [--roadmap FILE]
#     default   create missing milestones and close the ones whose phase is done
#     --check   change nothing; report what is missing or drifted
#   FORGE_DRY_RUN=1  the milestone READ is still real (see the read below); only the writes are held
#                    and printed as `[dry-run]` lines. The summary line then says `would create` or
#                    `would close`, never `created` or `closed`, because nothing was sent (#307).
#                    Only the exact value 1 counts, as in forge-lib.sh; `true` is a real run.
#
# Exit codes are distinguishable, because this runs from automation:
#   0  in sync (or synced successfully)
#   1  --check found drift; nothing is wrong with the tooling
#   2  usage or environment error
#   3  the roadmap is malformed; NOTHING was written
#   4  a write failed part-way; the host may be partially synced
#
# NEVER DELETES. A milestone that is not in the roadmap is reported and left alone: it may be
# holding someone's tickets, and a sync that deletes what it does not recognise is a footgun aimed
# at other people's data. Same rule and same reason as sync-labels.sh.
#
# NEVER REOPENS EITHER. A phase moved back from done to open is reported, not acted on: reopening a
# milestone is rare and is a human decision, and check-phases.sh rule 3 already reports the
# disagreement. Doing it silently would undo a close somebody meant.
#
# ONE MALFORMED BLOCK STOPS THE WHOLE FILE, rather than syncing the phases it could parse. A partial
# sync is exactly the drift this exists to end.
