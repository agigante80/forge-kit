#
# The public half of the leak guard: home paths, unlisted "~/" roots and reachable addresses.
#
# Stops the developer's own machine leaking into a repository that is about to be made public
# (forge-kit issue #99, split as #155). It catches by SHAPE and by ALLOWLIST, so it needs no list
# of private names and can therefore run in CI, in the open, for every contributor. The first line
# above is deliberately one whole sentence: the component index renders it verbatim.
#
# HONEST STATEMENT OF REACH. This would not have caught the leak that prompted the ticket. That was
# a set of real sibling-project folder names sitting in prose as demo data, and a folder name in
# prose contains no path and no "@". Rules A and C catch the pasted-traceback class, which is the
# one that recurs. Rule B catches the "~/" class, which is the one that survived a full history
# scrub. NOTHING PUBLIC CATCHES A BARE PROJECT NAME: that needs the list, the list cannot live in
# the repository it protects, and so it lives outside it and is checked by the private half. A
# guard that overstates its reach is worse than a narrow one that admits it.
#
# THE TREE MODES NEVER LOOK AT HISTORY; --history DOES, AND IT IS OPT-IN (#185, #191). `--all`
# and `--head` change to the repository root first, so from any directory they cover every tracked
# file and print root-relative paths (#401). `--all`
# enumerates `git ls-files`: tracked files in the WORKING TREE. `--head` reads HEAD's COMMITTED
# tree (#375; `git ls-tree -r -z HEAD`, each blob by `git show "HEAD:./$f"`), so an uncommitted
# edit, or a tracked file deleted in the working tree, cannot mask what a push publishes: the
# pre-push hook uses it. It is HEAD's tree and not every pushed commit. `--staged` reads the
# index. `--range` enumerates `git diff --no-renames --name-only --diff-filter=ACMT` between two
# endpoints and reads each file at HEAD, so a file added AND deleted inside the range is excluded
# at both ends. A home path committed in one commit and removed in the next is invisible to all
# four, in the public repository where it stays readable forever, and that is exactly the
# going-public moment this component exists for. `--no-renames` and the `T` are load-bearing
# (#208): with rename detection on, a renamed-and-edited file is status R and was listed by
# nothing, so the commit hook said clean on an ordinary `git mv` plus an appended leak; a symlink
# replaced by a file is T and was invisible the same way. The tree modes also FAIL CLOSED like
# `--history` now: a temp directory that cannot be made, a blob git has but cannot write, a
# tracked file this process cannot open, are each exit 2 with the file named, where every one
# used to be exit 0.
#
# `--history` reads the publishable history: every blob reachable from EVERY REF EXCEPT refs/stash,
# plus every worktree's HEAD (`--exclude=refs/stash --all`, the exclude BEFORE the selector it
# narrows), and every commit and tag MESSAGE (subject and body; the author, committer and tagger
# lines are what the forge already shows beside each commit and are not scanned). That set is what
# a mirror push sends: branches, tags, remote-tracking refs (a branch that exists only on the remote
# is already on a forge), refs/notes, filter-branch's refs/original backups, refs/pull and any
# custom namespace (#210: the first cut read branches, tags and remotes only, so a scrubbed
# history whose backup ref still held the leak scanned clean). A detached HEAD is over-reporting,
# since a push sends refs/ only, which is the safe side. Not reached, by design: refs/stash, which no
# push sends (--orphans reaches it), and a tag message embedded in a commit's mergetag header. One `git cat-file --batch` streams the
# objects and a POSIX awk reader counts each object's declared BYTES, so a blob whose first line
# forges a batch header cannot hide the line after it (a line-oriented reader would skip it). The
# reader puts no content byte, and no path byte, through a regex: Apple's awk aborts the moment a
# regex meets a byte over 0x7F (every such byte under a C locale on glibc; an invalid sequence under
# a UTF-8 one), and a reader that only counts and slices cannot meet that on any libc. LC_ALL=C is
# there for byte-length semantics, not to avoid that abort. Objects containing NUL are dropped
# whole, the stream's equivalent of grep -I (a genuine \001 byte drops one too, since NUL is mapped
# to it for awk's sake; the tree modes would read that file). Refs/replace and grafts are ignored
# or refused, because they make git show a different object than the one a push sends.
# An object is scanned unless EVERY path it has ever had is skipped (the binary and lockfile names,
# the allow-file `skip` entries, the scanner's own past copies), so identical content at
# "zzz.md" and "aaa.lock" is still reported. Cost on this repository, 4,300 reachable objects and
# 23 MB of content: about 3 s of CPU under bash 5 and twice that under bash 3.2 (measured 2026-09-14
# on a loaded machine; the reader itself is a tenth of that, the rest is bash judging matches),
# against fourteen seconds process-per-blob. The tagged stream materialises the whole readable
# history under TMPDIR once, and `hits` can equal it again, so budget twice the readable content on
# disk; awk holds the largest kept object twice in memory. NEVER wired into a hook: it is a
# pre-publish step, run by hand, and its evidence is REDACTED by default (see below).
#
# COST AND ITS LIMITS (#211, #239). Rules A and B are linear in the line length in TREE mode and
# under `--history --show-evidence`: the tail walk is one anchored match rather than a per-byte
# loop, the segment is cut with a shortest-match strip (`${raw#/*/}`) rather than `${raw##*/}`,
# which a 262144-byte dot-tail case in the suite pins with a mutant, and a trailing slash is
# tested before it is stripped rather than through `${m%/}`, which tries every suffix when the
# string does not end in one. A 64 KB punctuation tail cost 40 s and now costs 0.15 s; 1 MB took
# 2 s unloaded and 3.7 s under load. The REDACTED `--history` report is linear too (#217): redact
# builds its mask by doubling and the home arms cut the segment with IFS=/ read, and the suite
# times a 256 KB email match and 1 MB home-path and home-root segments under a UTF-8 locale.
# Measured on bash 5.2.21 and glibc; this repository's stated floor is bash 3.2.57, where the
# COST is unmeasured. Correctness does not rest on that floor behaving: a failed tail match falls back to the byte loop, so an engine that
# does not reload the locale the way `local LC_ALL=C` expects reports a finding slowly rather
# than missing it (review of #239).
# Rule C is linear in the line length in both modes: the anchored
# RE_MAIL keeps grep on its DFA, LC_ALL=C on the tree-mode grep keeps it there under any locale,
# and judge() splits the address with `IFS=@ read` rather than `${addr#*@}`. A 1 MB token followed
# by an address costs 0.08 s where it once cost minutes, which is what matters: a hook that stalls
# is a hook that gets --no-verify, and that is how this guard gets removed.
#
# THREE SHAPES THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT REPORT, the first two consequences of the above, each
# pinned by a test case so they cannot be rediscovered as bugs:
#   1. An address glued to a home path or root, `/home/<name>/<name>@<host>.<tld>` and
#      `~/<root>/<name>@<host>.<tld>`: rules A and B end in `/?`, which consumes the byte rule C's anchor
#      needs, so the path row is reported and the address is not. Dropping that `/?` would change
#      five existing cases for a shape no real tree here has produced. A separator between the two
#      (`/home/<name>/notes <name>@<host>.<tld>`) reports both.
#   2. An accented local part or domain in TREE mode, a local part with an acute e or a diaeresis,
#      or a domain with an accented letter, likewise: LC_ALL=C narrows `[A-Za-z]` to ASCII, where a
#      territory UTF-8 locale would admit Latin letters with diacritics. This is not a new blind
#      spot: --history has always run under C, and CI runs under C.UTF-8, where GNU grep already
#      misses them; the pin makes the laptop hook path match them. Widening the three classes with
#      \x80-\xff is linear and was costed, and it glues any preceding multibyte byte into the
#      evidence, so it is a maintainer decision rather than an oversight.
#   3. A `/home/` or `/Users/` preceded by a word byte or a dot (#230): `./home/<Screen>.vue`,
#      `src/home/index.ts`, `https://example.com/home/<name>`. Rule A is anchored on the byte
#      before it, so a home path glued to a word (`cd/home/<name>` in a pasted transcript with the
#      space lost) is not reported either. A real path starts at a boundary, and the fleet hit
#      that argued for this was a Vue screen importing its siblings from `./home/`. The same
#      mechanism as shape 1 applies to rule A against itself: in `/home/<a>//home/<b>` the first
#      match's trailing `/` consumes the second's anchor byte, so only `/home/<a>/` is reported.
#
# `--history --orphans` also reads objects no ref reaches: a leak amended or reset away is still
# in the local store until `git gc` prunes it, and so is a stash entry, which is the one ref the
# set above leaves out. A push (a `--mirror` push included) and a clone over a URL never send
# either; a bundle never carries an orphan but `bundle create --all` does carry the stash; a clone
# from a local PATH (git hardlinks the object store) and any copy of the .git directory carry
# both, which is the case the flag exists for. It is NOT what reaches a filter-branch
# backup: refs/original is a ref, a mirror push sends it, and plain --history reads it. An object that is also reachable keeps
# its paths and its skips; a true orphan has no path, so nothing is skipped by name for it and the
# self-skip falls back to a weaker content test (shebang plus marker line).
#
# --history NEEDS leak-lib.sh BESIDE THIS SCRIPT (#206): the reader and the object selection are
# defined there once, for both scanners. Without it (or with one that is unreadable or too old)
# --history refuses, exit 2. The tree modes, which the git hooks run, never read it.
#
# WHAT --history REFUSES, exit 2, because a store it cannot read honestly is worse than none: an
# alternates file (a `git clone --shared`, resolved through `git rev-parse --git-path` so a linked
# worktree's .git FILE is handled), GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES or GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY set (the
# second re-points the alternates check itself), and a partial clone, which would otherwise fetch
# every missing object from its remote during the scan. It also refuses, exit 2, a store git cannot
# read in full (an object reported "missing"), a path map it cannot parse (a path containing a
# newline), and any pipeline stage that fails, since a partial scan reporting clean is the one
# outcome worse than no scan. One cosmetic limit: a path containing a TAB prints truncated at the
# tab in the report label; the finding itself is not affected. The alternatives to this reader, a
# bash `read -N` (bash 4.1, and it drops NUL uncounted), a helper in another language (forge-adapt
# installs assets/*.sh only) and `cat-file -Z` (git 2.42), were each costed in #191 and rejected
# because this one adds no floor.
#
# The store holds more than file contents: on this repository, 1,639 blobs against 527 commit
# objects. Whoever scans the store by hand (#198):
# pass `grep -a` over a `git cat-file --batch` stream, because tree objects contain NUL and a grep
# then treats the stream as binary, GNU replacing matched lines with "binary file matches" and a
# wrapper that passes `-I` skipping the stream and reporting no match at all.
#
# A history-aware CREDENTIAL scanner is still a companion, not a substitute: `gitleaks git .` hunts
# secrets and this hunts the developer's IDENTITY, which is a different subject with a different
# false-positive profile. Running both is the answer.
#
# AND BOTH PATH RULES JUDGE THE FIRST SEGMENT ONLY. Rule A asks who "/home/<name>/" belongs to and
# rule B asks whether "~/<root>" may be shown; NEITHER looks below that. So a private directory name
# under an allowed root ("~/<root>/<client>/repo", "/home/<name>/clients/<client>/build.log") is
# invisible here, and the segments above the project are exactly what the ticket called the worse
# half of the leak. Catching those needs the name, which is the private half's job. This was found
# by review AFTER the paragraph above shipped, which is the argument for the paragraph.
#
#   check-public-leaks.sh [--staged | --range <base> | --head | --all] [--allow-file <path>]
#                         [paths...]
#   check-public-leaks.sh --history [--orphans] [--show-evidence] [--allow-file <path>]
#
# Exit 0 clean, 1 when something was found, 2 when it could not run. One line per violation:
#   <file>:<line>: <rule>: <evidence>                        (tree modes)
#   <path>@<oid>:<line>: <rule>: <evidence>                  (--history; commit@, tag@, or blob@
#                                                             when no path is known)
# In --history the evidence is redacted to two leading characters (/home/al***/, ~/se****/,
# al******) because a pre-publish report is exactly the text that gets pasted into a public
# issue; --show-evidence prints it whole.
#
# WHY RULE B IS AN ALLOWLIST AND THE OTHER TWO ARE NOT. Shape can decide that a first name after
# /home/ is a person and that the word user there is a placeholder. Shape cannot decide whether "~/foo" is private, because the
# string carries no marker either way. So the test is inverted: an allowlist of roots a document is
# allowed to show. That catches the case by construction rather than by enumeration, and it needs
# one thing from the project, a canonical example root, agreed once.
#
# WHY BINARIES ARE DETECTED BY PIPING INTO grep -I. The obvious alternative, asking git for a
# numstat, is EMPTY in a full-tree mode because nothing is staged, so every binary then reaches a
# command substitution, which drops null bytes and warns once per occurrence. A full scan prints a
# wall of warnings and reads font files as text.
#
# WHY THE SCRIPT SKIPS ITSELF. Its own source has to carry the patterns, so scanning it would
# report the guard as a leak. Its TEST is not skipped here: it is excluded by an allow-file entry
# in the project that runs it, which keeps the exemption visible in that project's own config
# rather than hidden in this file.

# NO `awk -v` IN THIS FILE (#259). `-v` runs a backslash-escape pass over its value, and the temp
# paths this scanner hands to awk (`types`, `labels`) are built under `mktemp -d`, so they carry
# whatever the caller's TMPDIR is named. Under a TMPDIR named `t\tx` (backslash, t) the paths read
# back with a TAB, every `getline` failed, and `--history` reported CLEAN over a committed finding.
# Every value now reaches awk through ENVIRON (`LG_*`); the 0-or-1 flags (`orphans`) moved as
# hardening only. The suite counts zero `awk ... -v` lines (scripts/awkv-count.sh, continuations
# joined), and no awk takes a file operand (#405): under a TMPDIR named `x=y` one was an assignment.

# ONE anchored match, never a per-byte loop (#239). Every bash parameter expansion is O(n) in the

# which is how a bracket expression takes a literal `]`; TAIL_PUNCT holds no `^`, `-` or backslash,
# so nothing else in it is special there.
# LC_ALL=C is load-bearing, not hygiene: under a UTF-8 locale a byte that is not valid UTF-8 makes

# directory called home, not a home directory. A real path always starts at a boundary (a quote,
# =, (, a space, the start of the line). The match carries that one leading byte, and judge()
# strips it before dispatching, as it does for rule C. `~` is excluded from the anchor class too
