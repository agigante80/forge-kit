# NO `awk -v` IN THIS FILE (#259). `-v` runs a backslash-escape pass over its value, and the temp
# paths this scanner hands to awk (`types`, `labels`, `names`) are built under `mktemp -d`, so they carry
# whatever the caller's TMPDIR is named. Under a TMPDIR named `t\tx` (backslash, t) the paths read
# back with a TAB, every `getline` failed, and `--history` reported CLEAN over a committed finding.
# Every value now reaches awk through ENVIRON (`LG_*`); the 0-or-1 flags (`orphans`, `show`) moved as
# hardening only. The suite counts zero `awk ... -v` lines (scripts/awkv-count.sh, continuations
# joined), and no awk takes a file operand (#405): under a TMPDIR named `x=y` one was an assignment.
#
# The private half of the leak guard: project and folder NAMES that must not become public.
#
# Its companion, check-public-leaks.sh, catches path shapes and addresses without needing to know
# anything about you; this one cannot, because deciding that a name is private requires knowing
# that it is (forge-kit issue #99, split as #156). The first line above is deliberately one whole
# sentence: the component index renders it verbatim.
#
# HONEST STATEMENT OF REACH. This header carried none until #185, which is its own small lesson:
# the public half states four limits carefully and this one stated nothing, so a reader comparing
# them would reasonably infer this half had none.
#
# THE TREE MODES NEVER LOOK AT HISTORY; --history DOES, AND IT IS OPT-IN (#185, #191). `--all`
# and `--head` change to the repository root first, so from any directory they cover every tracked
# file and print root-relative paths (#401). `--all`
# enumerates tracked files in the WORKING TREE, `--head` reads HEAD's COMMITTED tree (#375; the
# pre-push hook's mode, so an uncommitted edit or a file deleted only in the working tree cannot
# mask what a push publishes; HEAD's tree, not every pushed commit), `--staged` reads the index,
# and `--range` enumerates two endpoints (`--no-renames --diff-filter=ACMT`, so a renamed-and-edited
# file and a symlink replaced by a file are listed; both were invisible before #208) and reads each
# file at HEAD, so a
# name added and removed inside the range is invisible at both ends. The tree modes fail closed
# like `--history` (#208): a temp directory that cannot be made, a names file or blob that cannot
# be written, a tracked file this process cannot open, are each exit 2 naming the file. A private folder name committed once and deleted later stays readable
# forever in a public repository, and a NAME is exactly the thing someone scrubs from the tree and
# forgets in the history.
#
# `--history` reads the publishable history: every blob reachable from a branch or a tag, and every
# commit and tag MESSAGE (subject and body). The author, committer and tagger lines are NOT scanned
# by this half either: that identity is what the forge already displays beside every commit, public
# by construction: the forge shows it whether or not the scan does. The reader is the public
# half's: one `git cat-file --batch`, a POSIX awk reader that counts each object's declared BYTES
# (so a forged batch header hides nothing) and puts no content byte through a regex, NUL-bearing
# objects dropped whole, and an object scanned unless EVERY path it ever had is skipped. In this
# mode a listed name is redacted inside the printed PATH as well as in the evidence, since a path
# is the likeliest place for such a name to sit, though a name that appears ONLY in a path is not a
# finding here any more than in the tree modes; --show-names lifts both redactions. The set is
# what a mirror push sends: every ref except refs/stash, plus every worktree's HEAD
# (`--exclude=refs/stash --all`, the exclude before the selector it narrows), so remote-tracking
# refs, refs/notes, filter-branch's refs/original backups and custom namespaces are all in (#210:
# the first cut read branches, tags and remotes only) and a detached HEAD over-reports, the safe
# side. Refs/replace and grafts are ignored or refused, since they make git show what a push does
# not send.
# It is never wired into a hook: a pre-publish step, run by hand.
#
# `--history --orphans` also reads objects no ref reaches (amended or reset away, not yet pruned)
# and the stash, the one ref the set leaves out. A push (`--mirror` included) and a clone over a
# URL never send either; a bundle carries no orphan but `bundle create --all` does carry the
# stash; a clone from a local PATH and any copy of the .git directory carry both. A filter-branch backup under refs/original is a ref and needs no --orphans. With no path,
# the self-skip is the weaker content test.
#
# --history NEEDS leak-lib.sh BESIDE THIS SCRIPT (#206): the reader and the object selection are
# defined there once, for both scanners. Without it (or with one that is unreadable or too old)
# --history refuses, exit 2. The tree modes, which the git hooks run, never read it.
#
# WHAT --history REFUSES, exit 2: an alternates file (a `git clone --shared`, resolved through
# `git rev-parse --git-path`), GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES or GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY set, a
# partial clone, which would fetch every missing object during the scan, a store git cannot read in
# full, a path map it cannot parse, and any pipeline stage that fails: a partial scan reporting
# clean is the one outcome worse than no scan. One cosmetic limit: a path containing a TAB prints
# truncated at the tab in the report label; the finding itself is not affected.
#
# Scanning the store by hand (#198):
# pass `grep -a` over a `git cat-file --batch` stream, since tree objects contain NUL and a grep
# then treats it as binary; GNU replaces matched lines with "binary file matches", and a wrapper
# passing `-I` skips the stream and reports no match at all.
#
# IT MATCHES LITERAL NAMES, not shapes. A name shortened or hyphenated differently is a different
# string and is not found. That is the price of the list being exact, and the alternative, matching
# loosely on names this short, would fire on ordinary prose.
#
# TWO MATCHING RULES, CHOSEN PER LINE (#222). A plain name matches as a case-insensitive SUBSTRING,
# so `bramble` also catches `bramble-social` and `bramble_v2`, and a name embedded in a larger word
# IS found (this header said the opposite until #222). A line starting with `=` is a WHOLE WORD:
# `=ana` matches `ana`, `Ana.`, `/proj/ana/` and `ana-signals`, never `banana` or `analysis`, which
# is the rule a short username needs. A whole-word token may hold only ASCII letters, digits and `_`,
# and its boundaries are that same ASCII set in every locale: a byte outside it, an accented letter
# included, is a boundary, so `=ana` IS reported inside `mañana` (a stated limit, pinned by the
# suite). The tree modes run the substring grep as before plus `LC_ALL=C grep -w` for the tokens;
# `--history` runs one pre-filter over both lists and the awk tests the boundary bytes. Path
# redaction under `--history` stays a substring match for every entry, so a token inside a longer
# path segment is over-redacted in the printed PATH, the safe direction. Multiple `-f` and `-Fwoi`
# on BSD grep are an unverified limit until #220's harness exists.
#
# REDACTION COST (#217). The bash `redact` counts the length once and builds its mask by doubling,
# as the public half's does, so it is linear in any locale. The awk `redact` that --history uses is
# LEFT as a per-byte loop on purpose (#416 made it a per-BYTE scan that keeps two whole characters,
# since it runs under LC_ALL=C and the old byte slice split a multibyte name in every caller
# locale). Its string concatenation is quadratic on busybox awk (re-measured at 262,144 bytes,
# gawk 0.07 s to 0.10 s and busybox awk 29.6 s to 31.6 s), but its input is always a listed name,
# so its cost is bounded by a list entry, and the one
# pre-filter `grep -aiF` before it is slower at every size, so the awk loop is never the first thing
# to stall. The suite's text-count ledger on that loop pins this DECISION, not behaviour: a change to
# the awk copy updates the ledger and this paragraph together.
#
# For the going-public case, run a credential scanner as well: `gitleaks git .` walks the whole
# history for SECRETS rather than identity, so it is a companion and not a substitute.

#
# WHY THE LIST IS NOT IN THE REPOSITORY. A committed file enumerating the names you have been
# hiding tells a reader exactly what to search the history for. It converts a guard into an index.
# So the list lives in the unpublished agent config directory, and this runs LOCALLY ONLY. Putting
# it in a CI secret is the same mistake in a place with more readers and worse access controls.
#
# WHY THE REPORT REDACTS BY DEFAULT. The class of leak this component exists to stop is pasted
# output: a traceback, a shell transcript, a failing hook. This hook's own output is exactly that
# kind of text, and printing the matched name in full makes pasting it into a public issue the next
# leak. The file and line are enough to act on; --show-names is there for when you need certainty
# and are not about to paste.
#
# THREE BEHAVIOURS THAT LOOK LIKE LENIENCY AND ARE NOT. Every one of them fails in the direction of
# the guard being REMOVED, which is the only failure mode that matters for something nobody is
# forced to keep:
#
#   - A MISSING LIST exits 0 and says so. A guard that blocks every fresh clone gets uninstalled.
#   - THE OWNING ACCOUNT'S NAME is dropped with a warning rather than obeyed, in the TREE MODES and
#     only when origin's host is a public forge (github.com, gitlab.com, codeberg.org,
#     bitbucket.org): there it is in the public clone URL, so a list containing it refuses every
#     commit that touches the README. Public identity and private identity are different sets. On
#     a private origin the list is obeyed, and --history obeys it everywhere (#209).
#   - A VERY SHORT ENTRY refuses the run. Two characters match nearly every file, and a guard that
#     fires on everything is one its owner switches off within a day.
