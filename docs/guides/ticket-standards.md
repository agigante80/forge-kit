# Ticket standards (canonical)

This is the **single source of truth** for what a *ready* work ticket must contain. The five
work issue-templates (`feature`, `bug`, `security`, `infrastructure`, `design`) carry the form
fields that collect this content; this document holds the **rules and the rationale**. The
`ticket-gate` agent enforces the rules.

**This doc carries two markers, and they answer different questions (issue #94).**
`template-version` says *which form this doc describes*: it is version-locked to the five work
templates by `scripts/check-template-lockstep.sh`, so the standard cannot silently drift apart
from the forms that implement it, and bumping it is what makes `ticket-gate` re-synthesise every
open ticket. `doc-rules-version` says *which revision the rules text below is at*. A change to
the rules that does not change the form fields bumps **only** `doc-rules-version`, costs nothing
downstream, and triggers no synthesis. See `docs/guides/template-versioning.md` for the full
rule and why the two were separated.

Read this alongside `docs/guides/template-versioning.md`, which describes the version marker and
the gate's auto-synthesis of missing sections. The two are complementary: this doc says *what a
ready ticket needs*; that doc says *how the version marker and upgrades work*.

## Why single-source

The requirement text used to be restated in each template, in `CLAUDE.md`, and in the gate. Six
copies drift: prose says one thing while a template says another, and nobody notices until a
ticket is gated against a stale rule. Keeping the rules here, referenced (not restated)
elsewhere, plus the lockstep guard, makes "the standard is the same everywhere" mechanically
true rather than a matter of discipline. (One sanctioned restatement exists: the gate's
hard-fail bars, governed by the Precedence section below.)

## Required sections

A ready work ticket must satisfy every rule below whose scope the ticket actually touches.
Applicability is decided by the gate from the ticket type and the packages it affects; a rule a
ticket does not touch is marked N/A with a one-line justification, never failed. A rule that
*does* apply and is absent fails the gate.

### 1. GWT scenarios (Given / When / Then)

At least one positive and one negative scenario per independent condition, written against
specific route, model, and screen names where the ticket makes them evident. Vague restatements
of the description do not count.

**Scope:** any ticket with an observable behaviour change. The gate derives this from the
ticket type and the areas it affects; the author never self-declares it. N/A is permitted only
where no behaviour delta exists (a pure wireframe, a research spike), and the gate scores that
N/A claim like any other.

**Quality bar** (each point scorable by the gate):

- exactly ONE `When` per scenario; multiple When/Then pairs mean multiple behaviours, split them
- declarative, not click-by-click imperative
- names a real route, model, or screen where the ticket makes one evident
- the negative scenario asserts a SPECIFIC error code or message, never "it fails"
- not a restatement of the summary

### 2. Unit test specs

Concrete cases: a specific test file path, a concrete input value, and the expected output or
error code. "Add unit tests" is not a spec. **When a ticket creates or modifies an API
endpoint**, 100% automated coverage of that endpoint is required, enumerated case by case:
happy path; missing-field 400 with a specific code; **no-token 401; invalid-token 401;
wrong-user 403**; rate-limit enforcement; IDOR (user A cannot reach user B's resources). A
single generic auth test does not satisfy this: the three auth cases are distinct.
Where the change touches shared code, integration and regression coverage is named too.

### 3. E2E test specs

For any UI-visible behaviour: a specific test suite file, setup steps, the action, and the
assertion, for both the happy and unhappy paths. **API-only tickets mark this N/A with
justification** rather than inventing a UI flow.

<!-- adapt-droppable: emulator-clause (forge-adapt removes this paragraph where the project has no emulator or simulator suite) -->
Where the project runs an emulator or simulator suite, a ticket adding a user journey names the
emulator scenario it adds or extends, or states why the standing suite already covers it.

### 4. Personal data handling

State seven facts, numbered here because the templates, the gate and the `privacy-regime` skill
all count them the same way: (1) every personal-data field the ticket touches (name, email, phone,
GPS, IP); (2) storage location and encryption at rest; (3) erasure, including cascading deletion of
dependent records; (4) portability; (5) minimisation and retention; (6) the legal basis; (7) any
cross-border transfer. A ticket that touches no personal data marks this N/A with that reason.

**This rule names no jurisdiction on purpose.** Those seven facts exist under GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA
and CPRA, LGPD, PIPEDA and APPI, under different names, different thresholds and different article
numbers. Naming one regime in the default is not merely over-inclusive; for most projects it is the
*wrong* regime, and a gate citing the wrong statute is worse than a gate citing none, because it
looks authoritative. A project that IS under a specific regime installs the privacy-regime lens,
which names its own regime and adds that depth (issue #101).

### 5. Security checklist

Authentication and authorization requirements, input validation schemas, data-exposure review,
and the relevant OWASP Top 10 items for the change. Rate limiting is specified or justified as
unnecessary.

### 6. Required reviews

The reviews the ticket must pass before it is considered done, checked off explicitly. This is
the ticket author's acknowledgement of the gate, not a substitute for it.

### 7. Documentation currency

The ticket names the documentation it affects, in the project's documentation tree and its root
README, or states none with a reason. **Scope is deliberately every work ticket**: this is the
one rule where always-asked is the point. It stays passable because "none, no user-visible
surface" is a legitimate answer, and the gate scores that claim like any other N/A, judged
against the ticket's own file list.

### 8. Implementation and dependency concreteness

Judged against whichever fields the template provides (`implementation`, `dependencies`, `files`),
not a new form field: the templates already collect this content, so this rule adds no section and
no `template-version` bump.

- File paths and implementation steps are concrete, and match `docs/coding-standards.md` where the
  project has one.
- Build and test commands the ticket relies on are specified, so an implementer does not guess them.
- Every new dependency is justified against the standard library and the dependencies already
  present.
- Known scalability risks the approach introduces are named, N+1 query patterns first.

A ticket whose template carries none of these fields (for example `infrastructure`) records N/A by
domain, per the N/A rule below.

## Precedence

`ticket-gate` restates parts of this doc so they hold in installs without it. Those restatements
are sanctioned exceptions to the single-source rule above. `scripts/check-restatements.sh` verifies
this list in CI (issue #125). Each item carries one or more literal ANCHORS into the gate, and the
build fails if an anchor no longer resolves (a stale entry) or if the gate references a rule in a
section no anchor covers (an unlisted restatement). Editing a rule means editing every location its
anchors name, in the same change. An item with no anchor fails too, because an unanchored entry is
exactly the thing that rotted before.

Coverage is per LOCATION, not per section: a rule reference must sit within two lines of an anchor
that covers it. Per-section coverage was tried first and was shown to be worthless here, because
once a big section like Step 3B was anchored for a rule anywhere, a brand-new bar for that rule
elsewhere in the same section inherited the licence and passed.

**What the guard does NOT prove, stated plainly, because overclaiming is this section's own bug.**
Detection keys on the literal token `rule N` (or `rules N and M`), validated against the rule
numbers this doc defines. A restatement that paraphrases a rule without naming it is invisible, and
two listed entries are in that shape today: the security lens checklist, whose file contains no
rule token at all, and rule 8's implementation concreteness in the critic's brief. Coverage is also
per ITEM rather than per anchor, so a new bar for one rule an item names can sit beside an anchor
for another rule it names and pass (issue #138). So this list is complete with respect to
everything the guard can see, which is a narrower claim than the one this section used to make and
get wrong three review rounds running.

**Therefore: a restatement added to the gate MUST name its rule.** Writing `(rule 7)` beside the
bar is what makes the next one detectable. A paraphrase citing no rule number is the one shape that
can still fork silently, so do not create more of them.

1. The three hard-fail bars: UI E2E (rule 3), API endpoint coverage (rule 2), and the
   personal-data judgment (rule 4), in the critic's brief.
   <!-- anchor: "**UI E2E (rule 3):**" -->
   <!-- anchor: "**API endpoint coverage (rule 2):**" -->
   <!-- anchor: "**Personal-data judgment (rule 4):**" -->
2. The security lens checklist, which restates rule 5 point for point. It lives in the
   `ticket-gate-reference` skill since #109, not in the agent file.
   <!-- anchor: "OWASP Top 10: injection, XSS, CSRF" -->
3. Rule 1's GWT quality bar, which appears twice: in the Step 0c-iii synthesis table and in Step 3A
   check 4.
   <!-- anchor: "Apply the rule-1 quality bar" -->
   <!-- anchor: "(rule 1 quality bar, the checkable half)" -->
   <!-- anchor: "REFERRED to the critic's rule-1" -->
4. Rule 2's integration and regression coverage, and rule 8's implementation concreteness (build
   and test commands, dependency justification, N+1 and scalability), which the critic's brief
   carries as blocking-capable concerns. These joined this doc in #117 (issue #94); before that
   they existed only in the gate, so the list did not need them.
   <!-- anchor: "test-case quality and edge cases, including integration and regression coverage" -->
   <!-- anchor: "file paths and implementation concreteness" -->
5. Rule 3's emulator clause, which the critic's brief restates near-verbatim. Item 1 covers rule
   3's UI E2E hard-fail bar, which is a different clause of the same rule.
   <!-- anchor: "rule 3's emulator clause" -->
6. The Step 0c-iii synthesis table, whose rows restate the SHAPE required by rules 2, 3, 4 and 7,
   because the synthesis sub-agent has to be told what to write. Item 3 covers rule 1's appearance
   in that same table; these are the other four.
   <!-- anchor: "| Section | Derived from |" -->
7. Step 3A check 5, which restates rule 2's concrete-spec bar as a mechanical check, down to
   rejecting a bare "add unit tests", and also restates the N/A rule's own rationale.
   <!-- anchor: "legitimate only where the gate derives rule 2 out of scope" -->
8. Rule 7 in three further places: Step 3A check 6 (the bar), the critic's brief, and the Rules
   section (its every-work-ticket scope).
   <!-- anchor: "**Documentation impact present**" -->
   <!-- anchor: "documentation currency (rule 7) judged against the ticket's own file list" -->
   <!-- anchor: "documentation currency (rule 7) applies to every work ticket" -->
9. Rule 1's SCOPE clause at Step 3B. Item 3 covers rule 1's quality bar, which is a different
   clause.
   <!-- anchor: "an N/A claim is legitimate only where no behaviour delta exists" -->
10. Rule 3's UI E2E hard-fail bar AGAIN, restated as Step 3A's mechanical check. Item 1 covers the
   same bar in the critic's brief; this is the mechanical half, and no review round ever named it.
   The guard found it on its first run.
   <!-- anchor: "E2E specs is BLOCKING (rule 3)" -->

<!-- restatement-allow: Step 2.5 :: rule 4 :: routing row for the optional
     privacy-regime skill; it states no bar of its own and only notes that rule 4 still binds when
     the skill is absent -->

Editing rule 5 or rule 1 therefore means editing the gate in the same change. The list used to
claim the hard-fail bars were the *only* exception, which was false, so a maintainer editing rule 5
got no signal in the exact place this doc certified as drift-free.

Where this doc IS installed, its text governs, and three cases are distinguished:

- **Conflict.** The gate's copy and this doc state different things: **this doc wins.** The gate's
  copy is a convenience restatement, never a fork.
- **Absence.** A rule is missing from an installed (possibly adapted-down) copy of this doc: that
  is NOT divergence. Absence never relaxes a gate bar; only explicit text here does.
- **A stricter restatement.** The gate says the same thing at finer granularity than this doc (its
  three enumerated auth cases against a doc that once said only "auth 401/403"). This is neither
  conflict nor absence, and the extra strictness is **ADVISORY, never blocking**. The gate reports
  it as a gap in this doc, naming the rule, so the fix is to tighten the doc and make the bar
  legitimately blocking. A stricter gate copy must never out-rule the canonical doc silently, or
  the single-source claim is fiction.

## The N/A rule (load-bearing)

A coverage or E2E requirement that a docs-only, research, infra-only, or API-only ticket cannot
satisfy makes that ticket **un-passable**, which trains people to box-tick and rots the whole
gate. Every rule here is scoped: it applies only to tickets whose type and affected packages
bring it into play, and the gate derives that scope rather than asking the author to self-declare
it. When you add a new rule with a coverage-style requirement, give it an explicit
type-and-area scope here, or it will backfire.
